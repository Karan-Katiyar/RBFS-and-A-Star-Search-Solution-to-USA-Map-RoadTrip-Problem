# RBFS-and-A-Star-Search-Solution-to-USA-Map-RoadTrip-Problem

## Problem
Searching for Road Trips in the U.S.A. Considering the following table:

Table of direct/flight distances to Dallas (in miles).
___________________
Austin 182
Charlotte 929
San Francisco 1230
Los Angeles 1100
New York 1368
Chicago 800
Seattle 1670
Santa Fe 560
Bakersville 1282
Boston 1551
___________________

## Solution

We code an Artificially Inteligent agent to search for a trip back to Dallas from Seattle, having access to a
road map which should be implemented as a graph. We use the aima code (https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) to find the solution
and return a simulation of the RBFS strategy and A* Search solution.
